    Hi! I'm Long V. Nguyen (Nguy·ªÖn Vi·∫øt Long in Vietnamse), a first-year PhD student majoring in Computer Engineering at <a href="https://www.mun.ca/engineering/ece/" target="_blank">ECE Department, Memorial University</a>, Canada. 
    During my research, I‚Äôm very fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/trungqduong/home" target="_blank">Prof. Trung Duong</a>, a Canada Excellence Research Chair <a href="https://www.cerc.gc.ca/home-accueil-eng.aspx" target="_blank">(CERC)</a>, 
    and <a href="https://www.engr.mun.ca/~dobre/" target="_blank">Prof. Octavia</a>, a Canada Research Chair Tier-1. Before that, I graduated from the Elitech Program at¬†<a href="https://hust.edu.vn/en/" target="_blank">Hanoi University of Science and Technology</a>, Vietnam.
  </p>

  <p>
    My main research interests are Machine Learning and Quantum Computing in Intelligent Networks, especially Semantic Communications for Vehicular Networks. With the efforts in these fields, our key objective is to <strong>seamlessly integrate the digital, physical and biological worlds to develop a "wireless without limit‚Äù connectivity</strong> 
    in the realm of next-generation communication technology, contributing to the developments of Intelligent Transportation Systems. 
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm curious about everything novel and constantly seeking new learning opportunities, so don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or just want to connect!
  </p>

  <p>
    When I'm not working, I enjoy reading üìñ, swimming üèä‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, and playing my favorite sports like soccer ‚öΩÔ∏è and badminton üè∏.
