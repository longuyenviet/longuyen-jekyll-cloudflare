  In this study, we present a novel Stable Diffusion-based semantic communication (SDSC) framework that demonstrates high performance, characterized by an elevated bandwidth compression ratio (BCR) and robust noise tolerance achieved by diffusion mechanism integrating supplementary prompts. This scheme significantly enhances the system's ability to preserve data integrity and meaning in noisy environments. By introducing additional context-aware prompts during transmission, we improve the accuracy of received information and mitigate the adverse effects of interference and noise.
